		<h2 id="history">History of Inko aleph</h2>
		<p class="b">This religion is a religion established by 5 people who gathered under Hirashita and Hirashita in</p> 
		<p class="b">2018. At first, unlike other religions, the aim was to respect freedom, which gave birth to the</p>
		<p class="b">daily routine of respect. After that, it has passed various booms and continues to the present.</P>
		<p class="b">Although it is a religion with a short history, Hirashita's thoughts have been passed down to</p>
		<p class="b">many people and have grown to this point.</p>

		<p>I was saved by this religion. In the past, I was often sick and often sick, but after joining this religion,</br>
		it became easier for me to look forward by following the path of belief. After that, I became less likely to get </br>
		sick and felt the importance of penetrating the path I believed in. This religion is made up of acts such as believing</br>
		without binding. If you have any illnesses in your heart or surroundings, you may want to believe it.</P>

		<p>This religion is a very pure religion and always looks in our hearts. However, it always guides us regardless of </br>
		whether it is good or bad. It is also a religion that gives you the power to move forward by believing and asking yourself.</br>
		Just by believing what you need to do to enter the sect, you are always close to each person's heart and face each other. Each</br>
		person's way of thinking is different in how they perceive this religion, but this religion is so flexible and personalized.</br>
		That is why it is important for us to think in order to be saved, the religion says. If you hate this religion, try people.</br>
		It is ourselves who have to do the result, like the thoughts we made earlier. This religion requires actions that guide people's</br>
		hearts. I think this religion wants to say that the essence of a person lies in thinking and acting individually. Why donâ€™t you</br>
		believe it once?</P>
